# Docker Datastack

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikebirdgeneau/Docker-Datastack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikebirdgeneau/Docker-Datastack)

This project contains a general purpose set of Docker containers including:

1. Jupyter (with Python 3 & R kernels)
2. Rstudio
3. Shiny Server

We start with a custom set of packages for each based on things I find myself commonly using. 
The purpose is a consistent (clean) starting point for data analysis and/or application development.
